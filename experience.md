  <h1 class="page-title">Research Experience</h1>
  <p class="intro muted">
    Over the past few years, I have built, led, and contributed to research at the intersection of metal additive manufacturing,
    machine learning, and optimization. Below are my research roles and representative projects.
  </p>

      <h2 class="exp-title">🧪 Graduate Research Assistant, AnalyticsIQ Lab (LSU)</h2>
      <span class="exp-date-location">Jan&nbsp;2025&nbsp;–&nbsp;Present &mdash; Baton Rouge, LA, USA</span>
    </div>

    <p class="exp-desc">
      My doctoral research focuses on enabling trustworthy autonomy for cyber-physical systems in metal additive manufacturing.
      I co-authored a successful NSF proposal and support experimental infrastructure that integrates thermal, optical,
      and electrical sensors on a Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) platform.
    </p>

    <ul class="exp-list">
      <li>Developing a <strong>physics-informed convolutional neural network (PI-CNN)</strong> to fuse multi-modal in-situ WAAM signals for real-time porosity detection, validated using <strong>X-ray computed tomography (XCT)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Formulating a <strong>physics-guided LSTM fatigue model</strong> linking process-induced defects to structural performance by combining fracture mechanics with deep learning.</li>
      <li>Building <strong>ArcAssist</strong>, an <strong>edge-AI co-pilot</strong> (NVIDIA Jetson) that estimates melt-pool states, flags risks, and recommends bounded corrective actions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="exp-desc">
      <strong>Additional Project:</strong> <em>DrinkSafe LA (National Academies Gulf Research Program &amp; NOAA)</em> — supported data-driven analysis of environmental water-quality metrics and resilient freshwater systems.
    </p>
    <ul class="exp-list">
      <li>Implemented and debugged <strong>Python data pipelines</strong> for cleaning, aggregation, and analysis of water quality indicators.</li>
      <li>Collaborated on algorithmic analysis to support <strong>resilience modeling</strong> and place-based environmental literacy.</li>
