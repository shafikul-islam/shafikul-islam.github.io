  <h1 class="page-title">Education & Training</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    My academic journey combines rigorous formal degrees in mechanical/industrial engineering with targeted training in
    optimization, data science, and digital manufacturing. Below is a summary of my degrees, coursework, and professional
    development.

      <p class="degree-desc">
        My doctoral research focuses on <em>trustworthy and transferable autonomy for cyber-physical systems</em>—specifically,
        enabling geometry-invariant melt pool control and physics-informed generative models for self-healing additive
        manufacturing. Current projects include:
      </p>
      <ul class="degree-list">
        <li><strong>Physics-Informed ML for Process Defect Detection & Fatigue Modeling:</strong> Co-authored an NSF‑funded proposal, developed sensor-integrated WAAM platforms, and built PI‑CNN and LSTM models for porosity and fatigue prediction.</li>
        <li><strong>ArcAssist:</strong> Building an edge‑AI co‑pilot using NVIDIA Jetson to estimate melt pool state, flag risks, and suggest corrective actions for Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing.</li>
      </ul>
