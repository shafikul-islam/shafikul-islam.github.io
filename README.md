### Installation

Simply fork the repository and edit away.

#### Installation via remote themes

* Just setting `remote_theme: ankitsultana/researcher@gem` in `_config.yml` should work. Although in that case, I am not sure how
you would build your site locally for testing. If you know how, open up an issue and let me know.
* For more info, [refer this](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/).



**Note:** Customizing the accent color might cause merge conflicts if you later try to merge from `bk2dcradle/researcher` to fetch updates/patches etc. (applicable only if you have forked).
